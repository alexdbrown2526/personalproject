<h1> Podcast Web Application</h1>
A web application that I built to grow my AngularJS knowledge

The steps for cloning the app are as follows:

1. Run<code> git clone </code> in terminal to clone the repo.

2. Run<code> npm install </code>to install all of the dependencies.

3. The app runs side by side with Mongo DB so in a seperate terminal run<code> mongod </code>.

4. Now we are ready to start up so run<code> npm start </code>.
