<h1> Podcast Web Application</h1>
A web application that I built to grow my AngularJS knowledge(Still in Progress)

The steps for cloning the app are as follows:

1. Run<code> git clone </code> in terminal to clone the repo.

2. Run<code> npm install </code>to install all of the dependencies.

3. The app runs side by side with Mongo DB so in a seperate terminal run<code> mongod </code>.

4. Now we are ready to start up so run<code> npm start </code>.

This app was built using the Apple search API and interacts with podcast hosting sites to allow the application to both display the data and play podcasts via episodes in the cloud.

<h1>TODOS:</h1>
1. Complete authentication to allow users the option to login and add to their own personal playlist.
2. Add download functionality so users can download to computer.
3. Build a more visually pleasing media player.
